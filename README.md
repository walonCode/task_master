# Todo App with Next.js

A simple yet powerful Todo app built with **Next.js**, featuring a full-stack architecture with both client and server-side functionality. Manage your tasks efficiently with a clean and responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks seamlessly.
- **Real-time Updates**: Tasks are updated in real-time without requiring a page refresh.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with modern UI libraries for a smooth experience on all devices.
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: Combines client-side interactivity with server-side rendering for optimal performance.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication (optional, if implemented).
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage for tasks using a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun (package manager of your choice)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
   - Add your environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys):
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
     ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application pages and components.
  - `page.tsx`: The main Todo app page.
  - `api/`: API routes for server-side functionality (e.g., CRUD operations for tasks).
- `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., TaskList, TaskItem).
- `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers.
- `database/`: Database schema and migrations (if using mongoose).

---

## How It Works

### Client-Side
- The frontend is built with **React** and **Next.js**, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance.
- Tasks are fetched from the server using API routes and displayed in a responsive UI.
- Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, with changes reflected in real-time.

### Server-Side
- API routes (`app/api/`) handle CRUD operations for tasks.
- Tasks are stored in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) using an ORM like **Mongoose**.
- Authentication (optional) is handled using libraries like **Custom-Auth**.

## Deployment

### Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the repository into Vercel.
3. Vercel will automatically detect your Next.js app and deploy it.

### Other Platforms
You can also deploy your app to other platforms like Netlify, AWS, or Docker containers. Refer to the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
